          <p class="card-text">An equated monthly instalment (EMI) is a set monthly payment provided by a borrower to a
            creditor on a set day, each month. EMIs apply to both interest and principal each month, and the loan is
            paid off in full over some years.
            Borrowers profit from an EMI since they know exactly how much money they will have to pay towards their loan
            each month, making personal financial planning easier. Lenders benefit from the loan interest, as it
            provides a consistent and predictable stream of income.
